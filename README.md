Objective:
Claim all three ship parts scattered to the three furthest corners of the solar system! 
But, the only way to cross the space is to grab your friends, spin and use the centrifugal force to 
fling your friends across the inky blackness. 

Setting up a server:
Escape Velocity implements multiplayer through Steam's systems. 
When booting up the game, click host to create a server. Make sure that steam is open first!
If you want to join a friend, click Join and navigate to "Join Game" under their username in the steam menu.

Controls:
WASD to move
Mouse to rotate camera
E to grab your friends
    Spin your mouse to gain momentum and fling further.
    Pressing A or D also increases momentum
R to place a rope node
    When a second node is placed, a rope automatically connects the two
RMB to interact with ropes, allowing you to auto-belay across the rope

Hazards:
The inhospitable reaches of the deep are dangerous in the best of times.
Stay in the gravitational fields of planets to maintain your oxygen level. 
    10 seconds outside and you're a gonner!
